In here you can create an app or create another app,

1) Get the keys required after creating your app and put them into a file called config.ini
Note that there is no config.ini file in this repo as it has been ignored, edit the config_example.ini file with the correct details and either change the name in the BoR.py file to read config_example.ini instead of config.ini or rename config_example.ini to config.ini
