https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps In here you can create an app or
create another app,

1) Get the keys required after creating your app and put them into a
   file called config.ini Note that there is no config.ini file in this
   repo as it has been ignored, edit the config\_example.ini file with
   the correct details and either change the name in the BoR.py file to
   read config\_example.ini instead of config.ini or rename
   config\_example.ini to config.ini
